# To-do

### Navigation Bar

##### Functioning
* [x] Slide out click
* [x] Slide back on other click
* [x] Change z-index before other slide out
* [x] Fix 'stutter' on slide-out *Looks like the inbound menu gets raised above the outbound in mid-transition
* [x] Show menu item background while active, if other menu is open
* [ ] Make 'open' state override 'active' state in menu items. --> Try to open menu once it is active, it will fail.
* [ ] Transition between 'open' and 'active' states, currently jumps to 'active' position

##### Aesthetics
* [ ] Perceptually uniform color space

##### Responsiveness
Design drafts for portable devices before implementing
* [ ] Add min-height to main menu and navbar
* [ ] Add width-change points
